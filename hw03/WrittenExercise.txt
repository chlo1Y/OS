1.Since the scheduler only maps kerbal level threads to proessors, but 
    not user level, if the number of kernel thread is less than the number of 
    processing cores, then it means some processors will be unused. 

2.If the number of kernel threads allocated to the program is qual to 
    the number of processing cores, it means all processors should be
    busy. If one thread is blocked, the processor will stop working as
    well since there is no extra knrnel threads.

3.If the number of kernel threads allocated to the program is greater
    than the number of processing cores, but less than the number of 
    user-level threads, all processors will be busy running kernel 
    threads. If one knrner threads is blocked, the processor will not
    be unused. It will find some other kernel thread to run. User-level
    threads have no influence on this work schedule.
